# [<ins>Project 1: Honors Data Analytics Thesis</ins>](https://github.com/jackswank/Portfolio/tree/main/Honors_Thesis) 
A year-long, capstone research project culminating in a dynamic web application that predicts post-graduate salaries based on user academic and career selections. This project integrated deep learning techniques (Neural Networks) implemented in R (Shiny) with robust data engineering.
* **Technical Stack:** R (Shiny), Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Tableau (for dynamic reporting).
* **Data Engineering:** Developed a crosswalk bridge (originally defined in Excel) to link and unify data from CIP (Classification of Instructional Programs) and SOC (Standard Occupational Classification) codes, ensuring data integrity across disparate sources.
* **Modeling & Deployment:** The model was prototyped in Python and finalized in R, featuring dynamic user interfaces (UIs) that allowed users to test multivariate combinations for real-time predictions. The research was formally presented and documented in an Honors Thesis.

# [<ins>Project 2: Hate Crimes Database Project</ins>](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/Hate_Crimes_Jack_Swank.Rmd) 
A team-lead exploratory data analysis project focused on identifying regional trends and statistical disparities within historical US hate crime incidents.
* **Technical Stack:** R (RStudio Cloud), R Markdown (for reproducible reporting and documentation).
* **Data Methodology:** Performed advanced data filtering and data quality assessment on the fivethirtyeight dataset, specifically implementing exclusions (e.g., removing D.C.) to prevent skewing measures of central tendency.
* **Visualization & Leadership:** Led the project team, responsible for the complete R Markdown reporting pipeline, and utilized R's visualization capabilities to generate detailed US maps and other plots to communicate geospatial insights

# [<ins>Project 3: MNIST Dataset</ins>](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/MNIST_Dataset.ipynb) 
A fundamental machine learning project demonstrating proficiency in image data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for image classification.
* **Technical Stack:** Python (Coded in Google Colaboratory), leveraging libraries like Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
* **Model Preparation:** Implemented a rigorous data split strategy, reserving 20% of the training data for a dedicated validation set to monitor and prevent model overfitting.
* **Results & Visualization:** Successfully trained the model to categorize and label handwritten digits (0-9). Utilized Matplotlib subplots to visualize the predicted output and employed random image selection to demonstrate classification robustness across the dataset.
