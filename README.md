# [Project 1: MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/MNIST_Dataset.ipynb) 
* Coded in Python through Google Colaboratory.
* Used the MNIST dataset and divided it into training and testing sets.
* 20% of the training set was used to create the validation set.
* Handwritten digits 0 through 9 were labeled and categorized using subplots.
* Images are selected randomly, which gives different results each time the program is ran.
