# [Project 1: Honors Data Analytics Thesis](https://github.com/jackswank/Portfolio/tree/main/Honors_Thesis) 
* Prototyped in Python and created using R and Tableau.
* Year long project where this research was presented at a symposim and written into an honors thesis.
* The tool created allows for users to select different combinations of choices using dynamic user interfaces to determine expected salary.
* Bridges CIP and SOC codes by utilizing a crosswalk and incorporates neural networks and t-tests.

# [Project 4: MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/MNIST_Dataset.ipynb) 
* Coded in Python through Google Colaboratory.
* Used the MNIST dataset and divided it into training and testing sets.
* 20% of the training set was used to create the validation set.
* Handwritten digits 0 through 9 were labeled and categorized using subplots.
* Images are selected randomly, which gives different results each time the program is run.

# [Project 5: Queue Program](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/Queue.cpp) 
* Coded in C++.
* Menu is displayed after each action is completed to interact with the user.
* Insert, Delete, and Display are the main operations.
* The order of the queue is preserved through the implementation	of int d.
