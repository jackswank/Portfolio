# [Project 1: MNIST Dataset](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/MNIST_Dataset.ipynb) 
* Coded in Python through Google Colaboratory.
* Used the MNIST dataset and divided it into training and testing sets.
* 20% of the training set was used to create the validation set.
* Handwritten digits 0 through 9 were labeled and categorized using subplots.
* Images are selected randomly, which gives different results each time the program is ran.

# [Project 2: Ball Image Classifier]() 
For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities. 

I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning. For most of the cases this would meet the need of an end user of the app. To get these results I used transfer learning on a CNN trained on resnet34. This created time efficiencies and solid results.
