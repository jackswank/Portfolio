# [<ins>Project 1: Honors Data Analytics Thesis</ins>](https://github.com/jackswank/Portfolio/tree/main/Honors_Thesis) 
* The tool created allows users to select different combinations of choices using dynamic user interfaces to determine their expected salary.
* Year-long project where this research was presented at a symposium and written into an honors thesis.
* Bridges CIP and SOC codes by utilizing a crosswalk created in Excel.
* Prototyped in Python and created using R and Tableau.
* Python used libaries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* R used Shiny to create dynamic user interfaces and with the help of dummy variables R used the deep learning technique of neural networks (as shown in linear regression visual below).
* Tableau used a paginated report so that users can dynamically test for/search for different career and academic outcomes.

# [<ins>Project 2: Hate Crimes Database Project</ins>](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/Hate_Crimes_Jack_Swank.Rmd) 
* Coded in R through RStudio Cloud.
* Data from fivethirtyeight package, specifically, the hate_crimes dataset.
* Group project where I was the leader and responsible for the R markdown document, 
creation of US maps, and corresponding descriptions.
* Implemented data filtering through the exclusion of DC in some results as it would throw off measures of central tendency.

# [<ins>Project 3: MNIST Dataset</ins>](https://github.com/jackswank/portfolio/blob/main/MNIST_Dataset.ipynb) 
* Coded in Python.
* Used the MNIST dataset and divided it into training and testing sets.
* 20% of the training set was used to create the validation set.
* Handwritten digits 0 through 9 were labeled and categorized using subplots.
* Images are selected randomly, which gives different results each time the program is run.
